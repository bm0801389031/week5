## first program
1.

 Description:

Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.

For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 because 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9.

## third program
3. is n divisable by x and y

Description:

Create a function that checks if a number n is divisible by two numbers x AND y. All inputs are positive, non-zero digits.

Examples:
1) n =   3, x = 1, y = 3 =>  true because   3 is divisible by 1 and 3
2) n =  12, x = 2, y = 6 =>  true because  12 is divisible by 2 and 6
3) n = 100, x = 5, y = 3 => false because 100 is not divisible by 3
4) n =  12, x = 7, y = 5 => false because  12 is neither divisible by 7 nor 5

## fourth program
4. 
Description:

Your task is to create a function that does four basic mathematical operations.

The function should take three arguments - operation(string/char), value1(number), value2(number).
The function should return result of numbers after applying the chosen operation.

Examples

basicOp('+', 4, 7)         // Output: 11
basicOp('-', 15, 18)       // Output: -3
basicOp('*', 5, 5)         // Output: 25
basicOp('/', 49, 7)        // Output: 7

## fifth program
5. 
keep hydrated
Description:

Nathan loves cycling.

Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.

You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the smallest value.

For example:

time = 3 ----> litres = 1

time = 6.7---> litres = 3

time = 11.8--> litres = 5
