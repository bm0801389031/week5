## first program
1.

 Description:

Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.

For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 because 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9.

## third program
3. is n divisable by x and y

Description:

Create a function that checks if a number n is divisible by two numbers x AND y. All inputs are positive, non-zero digits.

Examples:
1) n =   3, x = 1, y = 3 =>  true because   3 is divisible by 1 and 3
2) n =  12, x = 2, y = 6 =>  true because  12 is divisible by 2 and 6
3) n = 100, x = 5, y = 3 => false because 100 is not divisible by 3
4) n =  12, x = 7, y = 5 => false because  12 is neither divisible by 7 nor 5

## fourth program
4. 
Description:

Your task is to create a function that does four basic mathematical operations.

The function should take three arguments - operation(string/char), value1(number), value2(number).
The function should return result of numbers after applying the chosen operation.

Examples

basicOp('+', 4, 7)         // Output: 11
basicOp('-', 15, 18)       // Output: -3
basicOp('*', 5, 5)         // Output: 25
basicOp('/', 49, 7)        // Output: 7

## fifth program
5. 
keep hydrated
Description:

Nathan loves cycling.

Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.

You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the smallest value.

For example:

time = 3 ----> litres = 1

time = 6.7---> litres = 3

time = 11.8--> litres = 5

Convert number to reversed array of digits

Given a random non-negative number, you have to return the digits of this number within an array in reverse order.

Example:

348597 => [7,9,5,8,4,3]

## SEVENTH PROGRAM

7.  

ABBREVIATE A TWO WORD NAME

Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.

The output should be two capital letters with a dot separating them.

it should look

8. 

Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:

findNeedle(['hay', 'junk', 'hay', 'hay', 'moreJunk', 'needle', 'randomJunk'])
should return "found the needle at position 5"

## tenth program

10. 
Count of positives / sum of negatives

Given an array of integers.

Return an array, where the first element is the count of positives numbers and the second element is sum of negative numbers.

If the input array is empty or null, return an empty array.

Example

For input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, -11, -12, -13, -14, -15], you should return [10, -65].

Beginner - Lost Without a Map


Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled.

For example:

[1, 2, 3] --> [2, 4, 6]

For the beginner, try to use the map method - it comes in very handy quite a lot so is a good one to know.

11. 
Invert values

Given a set of numbers, return the additive inverse of each. Each positive becomes negatives, and the negatives become positives.

invert([1,2,3,4,5]) == [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]
invert([1,-2,3,-4,5]) == [-1,2,-3,4,-5]
invert([]) == []
You can assume that all values are integers. Do not mutate the input array/list.
